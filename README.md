Hi! I'm in my last year of undergrad at Yale University, studying computer graphics in Dr. Theodore Kim's lab.
I'm available via issues on my repositories or at `<my github username>@gmail.com`.
My profile picture was generated with my [C++ RandomArt implementation](https://github.com/alexaschor/randomart).
