Hi! I'm in my last year of undergrad at Yale University researching computer graphics in [Dr. Theodore Kim](https://tkim.graphics)'s lab.
I'm available via issues on my repositories or at `alexaschor@gmail.com`.

I presented my recent publication "A Shape Modulus for Fractal Geometry Generation" at Eurographics SGP2023. See the paper and code [here](https://github.com/alexaschor/JuliaShapeModulus).
