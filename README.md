Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Yale Graphics Group](https://graphics.cs.yale.edu/), performing computer graphics research under [Dr. Theodore Kim](https://tkim.graphics). I recieved my B.S. in Computer Science from Yale in 2024. My research interests include geometry processing, fractal geometry and physical simulation. I was selected as a runner-up for the 2024 [CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award](https://cra.org/about/awards/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award/).

I presented my most recent work, _Into the Portal: Directable Fractal Self-Similarity_, this summer at **ACM SIGGRAPH 2024** in Denver, CO.
